# Tracking the Takes and Trajectories of News Narratives from Trustworthy and Worrisome Websites
Uncovering and understanding how influence networks push propaganda and disinformation within the wider news ecosystem remains a difficult challenge that requires tracking and characterizing how narratives spread across thousands of fringe and mainstream news websites. Using 18 months of daily English-language news article scrapes from 1,003~unreliable news (e.g., twisted.news), 1,012~mixed-reliability websites (e.g., theepochtimes.com), and 2,061~reliable news websites (e.g., washingtonpost.com), the large language model E5, DP-Means clustering, and zero-shot stance detection, we develop a system to isolate and quantify the relationships between unreliable, mixed-reliability, and reliable news outlets. We show that by utilizing the stances of website articles toward particular entities and network inference-based tools, we can track slanted propaganda networks (e.g., anti-vaccine and anti-Ukraine) and identify the most influential websites in spreading particular attitudes, not only on fringe websites but within the broader media ecosystem, helping the reporting and fact-checking of propaganda and disinformation.
